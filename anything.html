		Today is my first day of the WDI course. I have made a really terrible website, which you have the pleasure of viewing now!
	</p>
	<p>
		After lunch, we will add CSS to this, which should make it look slightly better. There will be colors and things!
	</p>
	<p>
		I suppose I will list off random things that I like, because why not. And I can't remember too much CSS and am on a different computer so I can't check my old work. Whoops :(
		<ul>
			<li>Ice cream! Because, who doesn't like ice cream.</li>
			<li>Why would anyone care about anything besides ice cream.</li>
			<li>I should probably change my profile picture to something ice cream related.</li>
			<li>Okay, so this was not the most compelling text ever.</li>
		</ul>
