			Today is my first day of the WDI course. I have made a really terrible website, which you have the pleasure of viewing now!
		</p>
		<p>
			After lunch, we will add CSS to this, which should make it look slightly better. There will be colors and things!
		</p>
		<p>
			I suppose I will list off random things that I like, because why not. And I can't remember too much CSS and am on a different computer so I can't check my old work. Whoops :(
			<ul>
				<li>Ice cream! Because, who doesn't like ice cream.</li>
				<li>Why would anyone care about anything besides ice cream.</li>
				<li>I should probably change my profile picture to something ice cream related.<li>
				<li>Okay, so this was not the most compelling text ever.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			I suppose that I could <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italicize</em> random things, but that looks pretty ugly.
